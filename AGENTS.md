# qb_pos_inventory_system — Routing Table (ICM)

Rule: **One home per fact.** Follow the pointers; never paste a copy of a fact that already has a home.

| Concern | Canonical file / path |
| :--- | :--- |
| Setup, run, demo credentials, ports | `README.md` |
| Architecture & Live/Mock matrix (+ cockpit) | `docs/SYSTEM_ATLAS.md` · `docs/system-atlas.html` |
| API contract: endpoints, auth, role matrix | `ENDPOINTS.md` |
| Unbuilt work, decisions, roadmap | `planning/MAP.md` (index) → `planning/audit-remediation/MAP.md` (all 6 phases built) |
| UI-refresh plan (in flight) + ledger | `temp/ui-refresh/TASKS.md` · `.superpowers/sdd/ui-refresh/progress.md` (both untracked) |
| QA how-to: run the app, roles, flows | `docs/testing/QA-PROFILE.md` |
| My knowledge gaps | `docs/learning/` (`gaps.md`, created by `wrap-up` on first run) |
| Session history & gotchas | `docs/sessions/` — newest date first |
| Branch, commit & review conventions | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| Django backend (6 apps + `services.py`) | `backend_django/apps/{users,inventory,pos,collectibles,requisitions,reports}/` |
| Flutter MVVM client | `flutter/lib/features/` · models `flutter/lib/data/models/` · routes `flutter/lib/routes/routes.dart` |
| Network layer (Dio, JWT, refresh-on-401) | `flutter/lib/core/network/api_client.dart` |

Every pointer must resolve (the one exception is marked "created by"); a broken pointer is fixed in the commit that breaks it.

## Test & lint

- Flutter: `cd flutter && flutter analyze && flutter test --concurrency=2` (8 GB RAM: keep concurrency 2; stop with `pkill -f "[f]lutter_tester"`).
- Goldens: `flutter test --tags golden --dart-define=RUN_GOLDENS=true --concurrency=2` (PNGs in gitignored `.superpowers/sdd/ui-refresh/goldens/`).
- Backend: `docker exec buildpro_backend python manage.py test --noinput` · `... manage.py check` · `... manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run` (host python cannot reach `db`).

## Workflow

- Build a phase with **`execute-phase`**; end a session with **`wrap-up`** (session note + gaps + this file's status block).

## Current Status & Next Step

- **Branch:** `feature/backend-integration` — 72 ahead of `origin/` (user `git push` pending; count stales on the next commit).
- **Last session:** `docs/sessions/2026-11-02-ui-refresh-wave3b-z1-clock.md` — wave 3b + Z1 copy sweep + test clock pin through `96137b1`; gate analyze clean, flutter `+1243 ~224`, goldens `+224`.
- **Next:** Z2 whole-app pass (`temp/ui-refresh/TASKS.md`). Blocked on user: reseed dev DB, teammate's 7 design items, adjustments "By" column, offline web till, "Movements" tab rename.
- **Proof standard:** a test covers a fix only after it fails without the fix; a claim without its command output in the same message is unverified.
- **Caveats:** desktop pixels are user-verified only (`flutter run -d linux`); `.superpowers/` is gitignored, so ledgers live only on this machine.
